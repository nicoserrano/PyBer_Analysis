# PyBer_Analysis

#### Analysis on ridesharing data using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib Libraries. 

## Overview
In this project I will be working with ridesharing data from different cities located in urban, suburban, and rural areas. The goal will be to produce a complete analysis with visualizations in order to help PyBer improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

## Resources
- Data sources:
  - city_data.csv
  - ride_data.csv

- Software:
  - Python 6.3.1
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy Libraries 

## Results

Ridesharing services are priced based on supply and demand. Clearly, there are more rides and drivers in urban cities as there are usually more people concentrated in the big cities. Then come suburban cities in second place and rural in last place.

This bubble plot shows how even though rural areas have less rides, their fares are relatively more expensive. Also, there are less drivers available in this type of cities as bubbles are smaller. Suburban cities are in the midpoint between the other two. Their fares are average price and their number of rides range in between 10 to 25 rides per city. Again, with somewhat more drivers available than rural areas but less than urban. And lastly, urban cities happen to have lower fare prices but a lot more rides.

Almost 69% of the rides, and therefore the market, come from urban areas. And only 5% from rural.

Urban areas also happen to have the majority of the drivers and rural the minority.

As for fares, urban areas have the majority with a 63%. Suburban and rural still have a relatively big part of the whole as their fares are more expensive.
