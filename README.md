# PyBer_Analysis

#### Analysis on ridesharing data using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib Libraries. 

## Overview
In this project I will be working with ridesharing data from different cities located in urban, suburban, and rural areas. The goal will be to produce a complete analysis with visualizations in order to help PyBer improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

- Data sources:
  - city_data.csv
  - ride_data.csv

- Software:
  - Python 6.3.1
  - Jupyter Notebook
